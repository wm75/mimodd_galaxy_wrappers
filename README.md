### What is this about? ###

[MiModD](http://www.celegans.de/mimodd) is an integrated solution for
mapping-by-sequencing analysis of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from
laboratory model organisms. It enables geneticists to identify the genetic
mutations present in an organism starting from just raw WGS read data and a
reference genome without the help of a trained bioinformatician. Its linkage
analysis engine NacreousMap represents a further development of and can be used
as a drop-in replacement for CloudMap.

The Galaxy tool wrappers for MiModD provide access to virtually all
functionality of the package when installed into an instance of Galaxy. This
repository holds the development version of the MiModD tool wrappers from which
release versions are uploaded to the Galaxy Tool Shed.

For further information about installing MiModD from a Galaxy Tool Shed please
refer to the [MiModD User Guide](http://mimodd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html).
