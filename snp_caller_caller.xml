   **What it does**

The tool transforms the read-centered information in the aligned reads input
datasets into position-centered information including variant call statistics
(using samtools mpileup and bcftools internally).

**It produces a BCF file that serves as the basis for all further variant
analyses with MiModD**.

-----

**Notes on Advanced Settings:**

**MD5 checksums**

By default, the tool will check whether the input BAM dataset(s) provide(s) MD5
checksums for the reference genome contig/chromosome sequences used during read
alignment (e.g., the *MiModD Read Alignment* tool stores these in the BAM file
header). If it finds MD5 sums for all sequences, it will compare them to the
checksums of the reference genome sequences used in the current tool run and
abort with an error message if there is a discrepancy between them. If it finds
contigs/chromosomes with matching checksum, but different names in the aligned
reads dataset(s) and the reference genome dataset, it will use the name from
the reference genome in its output.

This behavior has two benefits:

1) It protects from accidental variant calling against a wrong reference genome
(*i.e.*, a different one than that used during the alignment step), which would
result in wrong calls. This is the primary reason why we recommend to leave the
check activated.

2) It provides an opportunity to change sequence names between aligned reads
files and variant call files by providing a reference genome file with altered
sequence names (but identical sequence data).

Since there may be rare cases where you *really* want to align against a
reference genome with different checksums (e.g., you may have edited the
reference sequence based on the alignment results), the check can be turned
off, but only do this if you know *exactly* why.


**Average sample depth cap limit**

For each of a total of ``M`` BAM input datasets, the tool will only pile up a
maximum number of reads ``N`` per position to avoid excessive memory usage with
very large numbers of samples sequenced at high coverage.
N will be calculated as the maximum of ``8000/M`` and ``DEPTH*S``, where ``S``
is the maximum number of samples found in a single input dataset and ``DEPTH``
is the *average sample depth cap limit* specified in the tool form.

This parameter, thus sets the average depth of the pile-up per sample that is
guaranteed to be used even when there is a very large number of samples. As can
be seen from the formula above, however, it will rarely become relevant for any
regular-size analysis.
